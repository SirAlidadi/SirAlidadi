I made this project just for fun, it allows you to create nice and simple GitHub Readme files that you can copy/paste and use in your profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on private project 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter & Godot 
- âš¡ Fun fact: Although it may sound counterintuitive, your small intestine is actually the largest (internal) organ in your body. 

```py
class Programmer:
    def __init__(self, name, lastname, age, programming_skill):
        self.name = name
        self.lastname = lastname
        self.age = age
        self.programming_skill = programming_skill
        
    def get_name(self):
        return self.name
    
    def get_lastname(self):
        return self.lastname
    
    def get_age(self):
        return self.age
    
    def get_programming_skill(self):
        return self.programming_skill

mohammad_hossein_alidadi = Programmer("Mohammad Hossein", "Alidadi Talkhestani", 20, ["Python", "Django", "Javascript", "React", "Dart", "Flutter"])
